This project implements the very basis of localized attraction repulsion between particle. The attraction repulsion of particle is a system where each particle is both attracted and repelled by all the other particles of the system. By introducing an attraction range and a repulsion range, the behavior of the particles starts to mimic life-like behaviors and it gives more flexibility to the system.

The idea is very simple, and I will use this project as a base for more advanced techniques that relies on this.
